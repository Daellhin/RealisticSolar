# RealisticSolar
Mod for Minecraft 1.7.10

Realistic Solar is a mod for Minecraft I made to get a better understanding of Java and Minecraft.
The mod adds solar panels and the machines to produce them in a realisic manner.

Curently the machines do work but dont use rf as I cant't figure out how to implement rf consumers.
