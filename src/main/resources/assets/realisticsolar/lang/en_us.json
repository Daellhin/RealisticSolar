	"page_disclaimer": "DISCLAIMER! \n\nThis mod is still being developed, so expect bugs and crashes. There are still a lot of features and mechanics I have planned, so stay tuned. \n\nYou can always follow the development on the Realistic Solar GitHub page (linked under sources on the CurseForge page). New builds will be available on CurseForge.",

	"page_arc_furnace_right": "Sand is composed of silica (also known as silicon dioxide), commonly found sand is full of impurities and thus looses its white colour. \n\nTo extract elemental silicon from the silica, it must be reduced (in other words, have the oxygen removed from it). \n\nThis is accomplished by heating a mixture of silica, carbon(in the form of coal) and woodchips  in an electric arc furnace. \n\nThe furnace heats the materials by exposing them to an electric arc generated by the graphite electrodes. By this method the materials in the furnace can reach temperatures in excess of 2,000Â°C.",
